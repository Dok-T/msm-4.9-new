* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. MSM FLASH

The MSM camera Flash driver provides the definitions for
enabling and disabling LED Torch/Flash by requesting it to
PMIC/I2C/GPIO based hardware. It provides the functions for
the Client to control the Flash hardware.

* Qualcomm MSM CAMERA FLASH

Required properties:
- cell-index : Should contain flash source index to diffentiate
    between different flash devices. These indexes represent flash devices
    for multiple flashes.
    - 0, 1, 2, 3
- compatible :
    - "qcom,camera-led-flash"
    - "qcom,camera-flash"
    - "qcom,led-flash"
    - "qcom,led-flash1"
    - "qcom,leds-gpio-flash"
- qcom,flash-type : Should contain type flash device
    - 1 for LED flash
    - 2 for strobe flash
    - 3 for simple led flash controlled by one gpio
      This is a low cost led used for camera flash, the led is driven by
      system power, and use a transistor controlled by external pin to
      gate its on/off state.
- qcom,flash-source : Should contain array of phandles to flash source nodes.
    - pm8941_flash0 pm8941_flash1

Optional properties:
-qcom,torch-source : Should contain phandle to torch source node.
    -pm8941_torch
- qcom,slave-id : should contain i2c slave address, device id address
    and expected id read value.
- qcom,max-current: Max current in mA supported by flash
- qcom,max-duration: Max duration in milliseconds the flash can glow.
-qcom,switch-source : Should contain phandle to switch source node.
      This is used to trigger dual led at same time to avoid sync issues.
- qcom,cci-master : should contain i2c master id to be used for this flash.
    - 0 -> MASTER 0
    - 1 -> MASTER 1
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
    for the flash operating in compatible mode.
- gpios : should contain phandle to gpio controller node and array of
    #gpio-cells specifying specific gpio (controller specific)
- qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num : should contain index to gpios specific to this flash
- qcom,gpio-req-tbl-flags : should contain direction of gpios present in
    qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num property (in the same order)
- qcom,gpio-req-tbl-label : should contain name of gpios present in
    qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num property (in the same order)
- qcom,gpio-flash-reset : should contain index to gpio used by flash's "flash reset" pin.
- qcom,gpio-flash-en : should contain index to gpio used by flash's "flash enable" pin.
- qcom,gpio-flash-now : should contain index to gpio used by flash's "flash now" pin.
- label : should contain unique flash name to differentiate from other flash
    - "adp1660"
    - "bd7710"
- qcom,gpio-custom1 : should contain index to gpio used to select between muxed
    flashes. Only used when the "mux_sel_option" member of "msm_flash_cfg_data_t"
    tells the driver to use the mux sel. GPIO is set to HIGH when flash is
    turned ON, LOW when turned OFF.
